          <p class="color-contrast-medium">In the <span class="spanTxt"> 1990s, we welcomed the first publishing
              language of the Web:
              Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML.</span> But the language – used to share text-only pages via a simple
            browser –
            was limiting. Many early web sites were basic, using vertically structured, text-heavy pages with few
            graphics.</p>

          <h2>The emergence of social networking</h2>
          <p class="color-contrast-medium">Around the 2000s, the internet had a significant increase in presence at work
            and at people's homes. With this, social networks leveraged an immense mass of users and from that period
            onwards, a multitude of services emerged.
            In 2002, Fotolog and Friendster were born, bringing photo-sharing options and becoming very popular
            especially among young people at the time. Then, throughout 2003, LinkedIn (focused on professional
            contacts) and MySpace were launched.
            Here we have arrived at the time when social networks fell in favor of internet users and turned into money
            machines,<span class="spanTxt"> 2004 can be considered the year of social networks</span>, because during
            this period Flickr, Orkut and
            Facebook were created.</p>

          <p class="color-contrast-medium">The company's stated mission from the beginning was "to organize the world's
            information and make it universally accessible and useful". Google began as an online search firm, but it
            now offers more than 50 Internet services and products, from e-mail and online document creation to software
            for mobile phones and tablet computers.
